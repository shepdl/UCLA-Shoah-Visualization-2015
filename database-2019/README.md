# Timestreams

These timestreams were generated using the following files, run in the following order:
 * calculate_base_probabilities.py
 * calculate_base_probabilities_second_level.py
 * create_timestream_data.py


  * This uses all testimonies for all victim groups, except for the Jewish
    Surviors, where we excluded those testimonies that had segments that were
    not evenly-divided. There are a total of 47,518 testimonies across all
    victim groups, with 44,429 of those being Jewish Survivors. Of these, 5027
    were excluded, with 5002 being Jewish Survivors and 9 being a combination of Aid
    Providers, Liberators, and Political Prisoners.
  * We did not fill in testimonies or filter out testimonies with inadequate
    saturation.


These also use the new top-level categories, as reflected in
`timestreams/timestreams.js`.
